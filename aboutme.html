        <h2>My favourite movie is <u><b>Sita Ramam</b></u></h2>
        <p>
             I like this movie because the story is based on real incidents and execution of the movie was 
             perfect. The screenplay is so interesting with the small twists here and there.Overall this movie 
             is a good experience for me.
